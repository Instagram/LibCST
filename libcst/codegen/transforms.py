# This holds a series of transforms that help prettify generated code.
# The design is such that any of them could be left out and the code
# in question will still be correct, but possibly uglier to look at.
# Great care should be taken to include only transforms that do not
# affect the behavior of generated code, only the style for readability.
# As a result, since these can be skipped without harm, it is okay to
# use features such as matchers which rely on previously generated
# code to function.
