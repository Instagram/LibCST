        a few other weird reasons you can ask Zac about if you're interested.

        Valid values for ``start`` are ``"single_input"``, ``"file_input"``, or
        ``"eval_input"``; respectively a single interactive statement, a module or
        sequence of commands read from a file, and input for the eval() function.
