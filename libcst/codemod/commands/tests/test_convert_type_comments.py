    Here are the key ideas that allow us to write fewer cases:
    - The logic for generating annotations is the same for all annotations,
      and is well-covered by TestConvertTypeComments_AssignForWith, so we
      can stick to just simple builtin types.
    - The application of types is independent of where they came from.
    - Type comment removal is indepenent of type application, other
      than in the case where we give up entirely.
    - The rules for which type gets used (existing annotation, inline comment,
      or func type comment) is independent of the location of a parameter.
